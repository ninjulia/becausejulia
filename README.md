# Code Repository for personal portfolio website

Julia Czarnecki | Design | Code | Digital

Code repository for my design portfolio website, [becausejulia.com](https://www.becausejulia.com). Project files are uploaded here for your code review and Netlify web hosting. I selected the Bootstrap framework for its ease of use and component library, although it notoriously delivers some code bloat. To combat that, I went with 11ty for a static site generator, known for its performance and low barrier to entry. In the future, I'd like to continue optimizing my use of both systems to deliver a more performant site.
