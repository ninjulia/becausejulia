<h1 style="margin-top: 0px; color: #00446a;">Maestro FAQs</h1>

<span style="color: #e36f1e; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 18px;">How do I skip
	commercials?</span>
<p>Using the Skip button on your remote you can skip forward 30 seconds, 3 minutes, 5 minutes or 15 minutes at a time.
	The default is for 30 seconds. Every time you press the skip button, the program will advance forward 30 seconds.
	This is a handy way to get past programming you don't want to watch or you may have already seen. Again, with
	Shentel Maestro, you are in control.</p>

<span id="addtime" style="color: #e36f1e; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 18px;">How do I add extra
	time to the beginning and end of my recordings?</span>
<p>Under Find and Record, scroll to until you find your series recording. Press the OK button to see all of the details
	on how Maestro is going to record the show. Current settings are shown on the left. On the right you can scroll
	through each setting and change it. To add five minutes to the start time select Start, scroll down and hit OK at
	five minutes early. You can do the same for when it stops recording. Maestro will now check for any scheduling
	conflicts. If there were one, you would be asked to resolve it now.</p>

<span id="space" style="color: #e36f1e; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 18px;"> How can I see how
	much space is available on the Maestro HD/DVR?</span>
<p>Bring up the Maestro menu and move to settings and select accordingly. Of course, you can readily add an external
	hard drive to increase the amount of storage space up to the maximum of 2 and a half terabytes.</p>

<span id="favorites" style="color: #e36f1e; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 18px;">How do I set up
	my Favorites Filter?</span>
<p>Just watch your favorite shows on your favorite channels. You don't have to program or key these channels. Maestro,
	smart as it is, just populates the favorites filter with the channels you watch over and over again. Inside your
	favorites, you can move through the list with your up and down arrows and make your choices accordingly &ndash;
	watching or recording whatever you like.</p>

<span id="search" style="color: #e36f1e; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 18px;">How do I search for
	my favorite shows to record later?</span>
<p>You can either search for your favorite shows by name or by category. To search by name, press the Menu button and
	arrow over to Find and Record. Enter the letters of the show you wish to record. You'll notice that as you enter
	letters the search results narrow down quickly. To search by category, press the Maestro button and again arrow over
	to Find and Record. Select category and scroll through the list of available categories to choose from. Once you
	select a category, such as News and Business, all of those relevant shows are available in one place. When you find
	the show you want to record on the menu, touch the OK button to tell Maestro to record this one time, record it as a
	series, see all times, etc. Maestro will then confirm that there are no scheduling conflicts.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #e36f1e;">How do I share pictures,
	music and video from my smartphone on my TV? </span>
<p>First, go into your phone's settings and turn on the file sharing
	option. (This will vary depending on your phone's make and model, and
	the capabilities of your phone). Next, go to the HOME NETWORK category
	on the menu. Select "Search For Devices". Once the Maestro has
	discovered your phone, select it from the list. The contents of your
	smartphone will appear in folders which you can browse. </p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #e36f1e;">How do I see what's coming up
	next?</span>
<p>Press the Up key to bring up the Flip Bar at the bottom of the
	screen. Move right to see what is coming up next. Flip Bar menu will
	allow you record the next show. You can choose from recording the
	series or recording it just once. Once again, Maestro checks for any
	scheduling conflicts.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #e36f1e;">How do I find the Arcade
	Games?</span>
<p>Open the Maestro menu and move across the horizontal choices until
	you come to Games. Its colorful options make it easy to find. You can
	select from a variety of games, including solitaire. Notice your show
	continues to play in the upper right corner uninterrupted.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #e36f1e;">How do I switch to the Grid
	Guide view?</span>
<p>The Maestro Grid Guide enables you to find the programming that you
	want in just a matter of clicks. Open the Maestro menu and move across
	the horizontal choices until you come to Settings and then look
	vertically for Grid Guide. Enable your grid Guide to see your TV
	programming information in a traditional time grid format. Once
	enabled, you can launch the Grid Guide view from the TV channels list or
	by pressing the diamond key on your remote control twice.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #e36f1e;">I only want to watch HD
	programs, how do I find them?</span>
<p>Open the Maestro menu and move left twice. All of the HD programming
	available is displayed in one place. The HD Filter includes all of the
	HD programming choices available on your Maestro, both live programs
	being broadcast now and programs that you have previously recorded on
	your Maestro HD/DVR . You can see the HD channels scrolling by in blue
	and in gold is the programming you have previously recorded.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #e36f1e;">How do I set up Parental
	Controls?</span>
<p>Open the Maestro menu and navigate to the settings icon. Scroll
	through the options until you find parental controls. You can lock TV
	ratings and movie ratings. You do not even have to lock just by rating.
	You also can lock by channels, if need be. These parental controls
	lock live TV, as you might expect, but they also lock recorded TV.
	Everything on Maestro is monitored when you are not around. Notice when
	you go to lock a rating, Maestro asks for your four-digit PIN. </p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #e36f1e;">How do I record my favorite
	TV series?</span>
<p>Open the Maestro menu and scroll to Find and Record. Choose series
	options. Find your favorite show on a list of things you have wanted to
	record. From this menu you can choose to record first run only or
	repeat episodes, limit recording to a certain time slot, and set the
	recording priority. The recording priority setting will be used by
	Maestro in the event of a recording conflict. If all 6 Maestro tuners
	are being used, the higher ranked programs will be recorded first. </p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #e36f1e;">How do I view pictures and
	video from my computer on my TV?</span>
<p>Open the Maestro menu and scroll until you see the Media Link Icon.
	Select your computer. You can browse by albums, by date, choose
	keyword, or just open up all photos. The folder names come straight
	from your computer. You can scroll photo by photo or Maestro can play
	the folder in a slide show.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #e36f1e;">How do I set up a recording
	for next Sunday?</span>
<p>With the Maestro menu, you can see what's playing up to two weeks in
	advance. With the press of a single button, you can advance your menu's
	clock ahead so you can see what is playing on all of the channels at a
	certain time. Find a show and press OK to record just once. Maestro
	will check to make sure there are no scheduling conflicts. </p>

<p><strong style="color: #e36f1e; font-size: large; background-color: #ffffff;">Is there a
		mobile app for the Maestro?&nbsp;<br>
	</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 13.5pt; line-height: 13.5pt;">Yes. You can
	download the app called "Arris Whole Home Solution" for your iPad or
	Android-powered tablet. This app will allow you to manage recordings,
	view the guide and use the tablet as a remote control.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 13.5pt; line-height: 13.5pt;">For Android -&nbsp;<span
		href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arrisi.mm&amp;hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arrisi.mm&amp;hl=en</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 13.5pt; line-height: 13.5pt;">For iPad -&nbsp;<span
		href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arris-whole-home-solution/id571770112?mt=8">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arris-whole-home-solution/id571770112?mt=8</span>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 13.5pt; line-height: 13.5pt;"><strong
		style="color: #e36f1e; font-size: large; background-color: #ffffff;"></strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #e36f1e; font-size: large; background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>How do
			I connect my tablet to the Maestro?</strong></strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 13.5pt; line-height: 13.5pt;">Make sure your
	device is connected to the WiFi signal from your Maestro network. When
	you start the app, it will automatically search and connect to the
	nearest player. The app will ask for an 8-digit code from your player.
	You can find this code by using your normal Maestro remote.</p>
<ol class="p-0 ms-4">
	<li>Go into the Settings menu. </li>
	<li>Scroll down to the Mobile App settings</li>
	<li>Select ADD. An code will appear in the window.</li>
	<li>Enter the 8-digit code into your device and select connect. You must agree to the terms
		and conditions to continue.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 13.5pt; line-height: 13.5pt;">Once the device
	is connected, you should not have to repeat this step, but you will need
	to be within range of the WiFi signal for the app to function.</p>

<p><strong
		style="line-height: 18px; color: #e36f1e; font-size: large; background-color: #ffffff;"><strong></strong><strong>How
			do I change which player I am controlling with the app?</strong></strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 13.5pt; line-height: 13.5pt;">
	In Remote mode on the mobile app, you can select which player you are
	controlling from a drop down window in the upper right corner of the
	screen. By default, this will most likely be a string of numbers. To
	personalize your players:
</p>
<ol class="p-0 ms-4">
	<li>Go into the Settings tab on the app</li>
	<li>Select Account from the the left hand side tabs</li>
	<li>Under Media Player Names will be a list of all connected
		players. Select one and type over the existing numbers with an easier to
		remember name, such as "Living Room" or "Joe's Bedroom"</li>
	<li>Repeat for each player.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong style="line-height: 18px; color: #e36f1e; font-size: large; background-color: #ffffff;">What
		parental controls can I set using the app?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 13.5pt; line-height: 13.5pt;">The app gives you
	the same setting as if you were changing the settings on screen. Any
	changes to the parental controls made using the app will be in place
	even when not using the app.</p>
