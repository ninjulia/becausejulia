  <h1>Crafting Emails with Accessibility in Mind</h1>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>Anyone who signed up for our email list should be able to engage with our messaging in their chosen method. Just as
    we develop emails to be viewed on both mobile devices and larger screens, we should consider our messaging could be
    accessed via various devices, by people with various abilities, in various conditions - such as in bright sunlight
    or
    over slow connections.</p>
  <p>Currently, the ADA has laws requiring email senders in the Education, Financial, Government, and Hotel industries
    to
    adhere to accessibility standards. While we are not legally required to comply with strict ADA accessibility
    standards, we should anticipate those regulations to apply to more industries going forward. Incorporating ADA
    standards into our workflow now will help us avoid a "mad rush" to comply not if but when it is a legal requirement
    for our industry to comply.</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding the legal requirement, those reporting some type of disability add up to a significant share of the
    US market. According to the US Census, over 40 million people in the United States report having some type of
    disability - this could include visual (such as low vision or colorblindness), cognitive (such as dyslexia or ADHD),
    fine motor skills, etc. According to the ADA, this adds up to a market segment worth over $175 Billion. Litmus email
    testing service reports email ROI as 42:1 in 2019, making optimizing our email a great place to focus our efforts.
  </p>
  <h2>How?</h2>
  <p>Each of our production teams share some responsibility for optimization. Ultimately, we should focus on crafting
    emails that are simple, and easy to follow regardless of device or environment.</p>
  <h2>Copywriting</h2>
  <p>Litmus' research indicates that the average attention span is just 13.4 seconds, so keeping copy concise is
    essential. Avoid jargon, and limit the use of acronyms if possible. Never rely on browsers to translate text, but
    send
    the text out to a copywriter for the best possible result.</p>
  <h3>Helpful tools:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Flesch Reading Ease Test
      <ul>
        <li>Aim for a score of 50-60 out of 100.</li>
        <li>A score in this range means the text is easy to read for 13-15yr old students, although you should adjust to
          your target audience.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Grammarly / Yoast</li>
    <li><a href="https://Readable.io">Readable.io</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Design</h2>
  <p>Consider that there are a variety of visual impairments. Design with low-vision, colorblindness, and cognitive
    abilities in mind, and don't assume a subscriber with vision issues will be using a screen reader. The email should
    still read well with images turned off.</p>
  <p>As with copy, simple is better. Use a strong hierarchy with sufficient text contrast and avoid overly complex
    layouts. Litmus recommends a single column layout - which avoids excess cognitive load and renders well in mobile
    devices. </p>
  <p>Keep text legible by using at least a 14pt font with a line height of at least 1.5 or 2. Left-aligned is easier to
    read than centered. If you change the link color from the default blue, use a color optimized for colorblindness and
    leave the default underline to indicate the text is clickable. For CTAs, ensure you have sufficient contrast between
    the text and the surrounding button color. Make the buttons at least 40px tall and provide plenty of padding to make
    it easy to click.</p>

  <h2>Coding</h2>
  <p>Properly formatted, semantic HTML is essential for rendering across all devices, with some key updates for
    screen-reader devices. We currently set unique alt-text on images and style them to preserve the messaging when
    users
    have the images turned off, which will also maintain the messaging for screen readers.</p>
  <p>In the HTML tag, make sure to set the lang attribute. Without it, screen readers could pronounce text differently,
    resulting in text with different intent. Be sure to always set the title tag, as screen readers will read this
    aloud,
    and set the correct content type (such as UTF-8 character encoding).</p>
  <p>All tables used for presentation should be marked role="presentation" so that screen readers announce the content
    within instead of reading the html contents. The exception to this, of course, is for data tables. Be sure to mark
    all
    CTAs with role="button" to indicate the function of the link.</p>
  <p>Use header and paragraph tags appropriately and encode all special characters. Be sure to use the correct header
    level (h1, h2) as well.</p>
  <h2>Hey Siri!</h2>
  <p>While the use of voice assistive technology is on the rise, it is important to note these technologies do not read
    emails as dedicated assistive technologies will. There is also a wide variance between how the various assistants
    handle an email and allow users to interact with it. Hopefully, some standardization will emerge in the future, but
    for now, here are some tips to keep in mind.</p>
  <h3>Alexa</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Will read all "hidden" text</li>
    <li>Won't trigger an email open as the tracking pixel is not downloaded</li>
    <li>Won't read alt text</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Siri</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tends to read fast, so some text may require unique hidden commas to counteract this.</li>
    <li>Will read the first 499 words of an email before opening, so leverage the preview text - consider including a
      voice-specific CTA</li>
    <li>Will announce emoji. ie: "smiling face", "airplane"</li>
    <li>Will handle acronyms differently depending on punctuation. For US vs U.S. Siri will read the first word as "us"
      and pronounce the second as "U" "S".</li>
  </ul>
