          <h1>Concept</h1>
          <p class="lead">This 5 part e-learning course was developed to promote top of funnel engagement for an international software company. Goals included promoting a new business model for existing and potential customers, establishing the company as a trusted resource with the secondary goal of promoting their new software.</p>

        <p class="lead">To be effective, the campaign needed to stand out in the crowded IT service provider space and convey how easy it was to transition to the new business model (with the company's help, of course).</p> 

        <p class="lead">I developed a summer camp theme that was a departure from the standard creative typically used by the company but still adhered to brand guidelines. This theme was used throughout the learning materials, including backdrops for the video produced in-house.</p>

                    <p>Leaning heavily into the summer camp theme, I developed a series of vector badges using Adobe Illustrator to encourage users to continue through the 5 step learning path. Badges were included on the emails, landing pages, video and eBook promoting the company's cloud services software tool.</p>

                <p>A total of 5 emails were created and sent out over a week regardless of when the user signed up to receive them. Emails were designed to render well on all devices, so busy business owners could review the content regardless of how they chose to view them. While the emails contained useful information on their own, the ultimate goal was to drive click-throughs to the landing pages.</p>
