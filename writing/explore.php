We're Shentel.&nbsp; We may be new to you, but we've been in business
since 1902.&nbsp; Back then, we were a small phone company serving our
neighbors in Virginia's Northern Shenandoah Valley.&nbsp; Today we bring
 advanced broadband services, digital TV, high-speed Internet and phone
services to more of our neighbors in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,
and Kentucky. We specialize in providing advanced services to rural and
underserved markets, because we believe you deserve the same level of
service that you would expect from a larger metropolitan area.</p>

<p><strong>Technology Leader</strong> <br>
For more than 100 years, Shentel has been connecting communities like
yours to other towns, cities, and communities across the world, through
our High-Speed Internet, TV and Home Phone services. We have a long
history of leading the way for allowing advanced services to reach our
rural customers. Our commitment continues today as we upgrade our cable
network and make plans to increase broadband Internet speeds across our
rural footprint. We will continue to be a leader in the rural broadband
market. </p>

<p><strong>Customer Service</strong><br>
We don't believe that you need to sacrifice customer service, or be
bound to a long-term contract and be subject to cancellation fees to get
 quality service. At Shentel we staff our call centers with local people
 that live in your community. You can be sure when you call, or come
into one of our stores, you will find that customer satisfaction is our
number one priority.&nbsp;</p>
