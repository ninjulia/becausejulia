<h2>What are Cache and Cookies anyway?</h2>

<p>They're files that your browser uses every time you access a webpage. As an extreme simplification, Cache files store
    how a website looks, i.e., images, and styling files, while Cookies store how you interact with the site, i.e., what
    pages you clicked on or the items you put in a cart.</p>

<h2>Why should I clear my Cache and Cookies? Are they dangerous?</h2>

<p>Cookies have been in the news lately because they are used to track you across the web to serve you ads, which could
    pose a privacy risk. While these files are not dangerous on their own, they can take up hard drive space and, after
    a while, may slow down your browsing experience.</p>

<p>Clearing cache and cookies regularly are critical when working on web projects, as these files are actively updated.
    Your computer may be read from outdated files and render unexpected results.</p>

<h2>Okay, so how do I clear my Cache and Cookies?</h2>

<p>When following the steps below, note that you will lose all browsing history, including items you may have saved in a
    shopping cart. Bookmark any links you may need to refer to later. Use a password manager to save any log-in data and
    have it fill in the information for you.</p>
