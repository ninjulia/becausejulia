  <p>We're Shentel. We may be new to you, but we've been in business since 1902. Back then, we were a small phone
    company serving our neighbors in Virginia's Northern Shenandoah Valley. Today we bring advanced broadband services,
    digital
    TV, high-speed Internet, and phone services to more of our neighbors in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and
    Kentucky. We specialize in providing advanced services to rural and underserved markets because we believe you
    deserve
    the same level of service that you would expect from a larger metropolitan area.</p>
