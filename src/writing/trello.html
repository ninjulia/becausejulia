<h1>5 Essential Tips for Using Trello to Manage Your Design Projects</h1>

<h2>1. Include an "In Review" column</h2>
<p>When setting up your board, go beyond the basics of To Do, Doing, and Done by adding an "In Review" column between
  Doing and Done. That way, you can see what projects need to be actively worked on versus those that might just need a
  gentle nudge to get going or otherwise put on hold. </p>

<h2>2. Create new project cards directly from Project Briefs</h2>
<p>Does it feel like your team spends more time gathering requirements than actually creating? Save time and mental
  resources with a standardized Project Brief in a web form. If you use a service like Blue Cat Forms, you can
  automatically collect all the data you need and have it placed exactly where it needs to go in Trello.</p>
<p>To enable the feature, search the Power-Ups for "Blue Cat Forms" and click to enable it. You can build out your form
  to show fields based on prior selections, such as displaying options for Digital Ad sizes only if the project is a
  request for Digital Ads.</p>
<p>When you're done building out the Project Brief, click the More Settings button to have it sent directly to the "To
  Do" list. Share the link with your project team, and now all your projects will be consistent and contain all the
  elements you need to get started.</p>

<h2>3. Review Figma files directly in the Trello card</h2>
<p>Stop taking screenshots of your Figma files and worrying if your cards are out of sync with your files. Add the Figma
  Power-Up and your reviewers will never have to leave the Trello card to review the files. Images auto-update so that's
  one less barrier between your team and project completion.</p>
<p>You can access the Power-up here: <a href="https://trello.com/power-ups/59b2e7611e6ece0b35eac16a"

<h2>4. Use a time tracking Power-Up</h2>
<p>How many times have you gotten started on a project but forgot to record the time you spent working? When you
  integrate a time tracking tool like Toggl you can start a timer from the moment you start reviewing the card, and
  you'll have the timer conveniently ready to stop when you're posting your work to the card for review.</p>
<p>The Toggl Power-Up will show your timer on every card, so if you switch to another task without stopping the timer on
  your previous card, you'll have the chance to update before things get out of hand.</p>

<h2>5. Document how your team uses your Trello board</h2>
<p>The beauty of Trello boards is they are flexible, and every team can customize them to fit their workflow. But what's
  the best way to document what that workflow is? And where do you keep that information?</p>
<p>By using the "Read Me" Power-Up, you can set up a document to accompany your board, where everyone can quickly refer
  to it without leaving the Trello app. </p>
<p>To get started, search the Power-Ups for Read Me and enable it. You could record instructions that would help onboard
  a new team member, post helpful tips and tricks, or whatever else would be a great accompaniment to your board.</p>
<p>For the best user experience, have the Read Me pop up on the initial visit and whenever the text is updated. Select
  the "Show "Read Me" button" on the board so your team can refer back to it as needed.</p>
