      <h1>Tips for buying a HDTV for the holidays</h1>
      <p>The holiday season is unofficially HDTV discount season. Whether it's time to upgrade your current flat screen
        or add a new TV, check out these handy HDTV buying tips before you brave the electronics store.

      <h3>Added features</h3>
      <p>Smart TVs have been on the market for the last few years and have changed our lives. Smart TVs or Internet
        enabled TVs have a suite of apps that allow you to instantly access your favorite online entertainment or video
        streaming services. When shopping for a Smart TV, make sure you look for the apps you want to use. Remember that
        Netflix, Amazon Instant, Hulu Plus and other video streaming services require an additional monthly fee.</p>
      <p>Although the hype around 3D-ready TVs has died down, many TVs are still featuring 3D capability. In order to
        view the 3D effects, you'll still need glasses and 3D specific content which has been hard to come by.</p>

      <h3>Resolution</h3>
      <p>For screens under 34", you won't notice a difference between "HD Ready" 720p and "True HD" 1080p. But as
        1080pTV are coming down in price, 720p TVs are getting harder to come by. Some manufactures are rolling out 4K
        or Ultra HD TVs which have twice the resolution of True HD, but prices start at around $5,000. </p>

      <h3>Screen type</h3>
      <p>This comes down to personal preference and the conditions of the room you'll be watching TV in. LCD screens are
        generally cheaper and energy efficient, but can make motion blur more noticeable. LED is a type of LCD screen
        that is brighter and even more energy efficient. LED is best for rooms with a lot of light. Plasma is more
        expensive to own and operate, but it is ideal for a home theater set up as it has a wider viewing angle and
        better black level performance. The glass screen can cause glare in bright rooms. You may have heard about the
        new screen technology, OLED. This promises the largest, flattest, and best quality displays available.
        Unfortunately, it also comes with a hefty price tag.</p>

      <h3>Screen size</h3>
      <p>A good rule of thumb is to measure the distance from your couch to where you'd like to place the HDTV and
        divide that distance by three. If you had a 12 foot distance between the couch and the TV, you should get a four
        foot or 48 inch TV. If you are placing the TV in a piece of furniture, make sure you have at least an inch on
        all sides for ventilation.</p>

      <h3>Input types</h3>
      <p>You'll want at least 3 HDMI ports, one for your cable box, another for DVD/Blu-ray player, and one for your
        gaming console. Many TVs now incorporate USB ports or SD card slots so you can easily view pictures. Older AV
        ports are still available if you need to connect your Wii or Commodore 64 console.
