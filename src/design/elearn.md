This 5 part e-learning course was developed to promote top of funnel engagement for an international software company. Goals included promoting a new business model for existing and potential customers, establishing the company as a trusted resource with the secondary goal of promoting their new software.

To be effective, the campaign needed to stand out in the crowded IT service provider space and convey how easy it was to transition to the new business model (with the company's help, of course).

I developed a summer camp theme that was a departure from the standard creative typically used by the company but still adhered to brand guidelines. This theme was used throughout the learning materials, including backdrops for the video produced in-house.
