This e-learning course aimed to increase top-of-funnel engagement for the international IT SaaS company, ConnectWise, Inc. Its goals included promoting a new business model for IT Managed Service Providers (MSPs) while establishing ConnectWise as a trusted resource to help MSPs make the transition via a new software offering.

To be effective, the campaign needed to stand out in the crowded MSP space and convey how easy it was to transition to the new Cloud Services Provider business model. I developed a summer camp design that was a departure from the standard creative typically used by the company but still adhered to brand guidelines. This design was used throughout the learning materials, including backdrops for the video produced in-house.
