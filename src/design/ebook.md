More than just an eBook, this marketing deliverable established a brand look and feel for a start-up software company that was quickly growing into an international presence. In addition, this asset also set the template for other marketing materials establishing a brand tone that was friendly, knowledgeable, and dedicated to supporting the business goals of their customers.

Working closely with the content writer, I developed the design and layout for the new eBook, developing brand standards in the process. Since launching, the eBook receives over 1,000 download requests per month.
