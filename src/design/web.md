My work for the cable and internet service provider began with a ground-up redesign to unite their four legacy web
properties into one unified website. Goals for launch included implementing the Sitecore CMS, including an on-line
ordering system and support chat. My work ranged from initial content strategies and design to coordinating with
external vendors and internal departments to make sure the right content was migrated and that vendor deliverables
passed muster.
