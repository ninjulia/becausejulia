featuretteSubhead1: From a brochure website to a sales tool.
featuretteContent1: "In addition to shepherding the data migration, I developed all banner imagery and adapted print materials for use on the web. A year after launch, the company underwent an extensive rebranding, and it fell on me to update the website theming and develop new graphics to emphasize the companyâ€™s goal of being a trusted and valued partner in the communities they serviced."

featuretteHeadline2: Interactive Tools.
featuretteSubhead2: Demystifying the buying process.
featuretteContent2: "As one of the first post-launch feature enhancements of the website, I initiated, designed and
coded an interactive tool allowing users to quickly see their options by selecting services or sorting by monthly cost.
Users could customize their options by adding or removing services before committing to the checkout
process./nAdditionally, I also developed an interactive internet download speed simulator to help customers visualize
internet speed differences and select an option that was right for them."

featuretteContent3: "Once the website launched, the work was just getting started. Daily maintenance and analytics
reporting fell on my shoulders as I continued managing web initiatives - including implementing email and digital
campaigns. Special projects included building a subsection promoting a new over-the-top cable device with a video
player, FAQs and other product specific resources."

My work for the cable and internet service provider began with a ground-up redesign to unite their four legacy web
properties into one unified website. Goals for launch included implementing the Sitecore CMS, including an on-line
ordering system and support chat. My work ranged from initial content strategies and design to coordinating with
external vendors and internal departments to make sure the right content was migrated and that vendor deliverables
passed muster.
