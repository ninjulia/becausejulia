This digital marketing set consists of six banners for use with Google display ads and Facebook social media marketing. Developed for the fictional band, VHS Actually, to promote their Press Any Key to Continue Summer Tour 2021 based on their latest album of the same name. Artwork from the album was leveraged to further reinforce the connection between the album and the tour.
