          <h1>Concept</h1>
          <p class="lead">More than just an eBook, this marketing deliverable established a brand look and feel for a start-up software company that was quickly growing into an international presence. In addition to establishing a look and feel for their collection of eBooks, this asset also set the template for other marketing materials establishing a brand tone that was friendly, knowledgeable, and dedicated to supporting the business goals of their customers.</p>
          <p class="lead">Working closely with the copywriter, I developed the design and layout for the new eBook, developing brand standards in the process. Since launching, the eBook receives over 1,000 download requests per month.</p>
