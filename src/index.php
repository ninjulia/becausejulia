                        <p>Web projects really never end. Each project requires research, design, coding and then more research, more design â€” well, you get the point. There's always something to improve and always something new to learn. That's what I love about working with the web.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-primary">I wear many hats.</h2>
                        <p>Working in small groups (both in agencies and as part of an in-house creative team) has sharpened my multi-tasking skills. I've taken on roles usually divided between different departments in other companies. I've tackled video production, thrown down on copy writing, and after the project has shipped, I'm behind the scenes checking to see how the users are reacting to the designs.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-primary">But more about me.</h2>
                        <p>In my spare time I love being taken for walks by my dog, exploring new cities and keeping up with web design trends and technologies. I am always looking to expand my horizons by taking on new projects and meeting new people. So reach out and <a href="#contact">drop me a line</a>.</p>
