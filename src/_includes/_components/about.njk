                    My past <span id="myExp"></span> years working for IT Software-as-a-Service companies have taught me
                    design is more than just aesthetics. A brand is more than the latest campaign or trendy effect, it
                    is how your customers feel â€” before and after the sale. I focus on producing assets that appeal on
                    an emotional level, regardless of the medium. We are all human, after all.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-primary">I'm a team player.</h3>
                <p class="p-4">
                    Throughout my career, I've worked in small agencies, as part of in-house creative teams, and as a
                    solo freelancer. I have led and executed design projects for multi-million-dollar product launches,
                    webinars, international conferences, website launches, and more. I have collaborated with
                    cross-functional teams of copywriters, developers, marketers, and subject matter experts to
                    deliver engaging solutions. I'd love to see what we can accomplish together.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-primary">I'm accomplished.</h3>

                <p>
                    While I am committed to quality and attention to detail, I don't like to take myself too seriously.
                    In my spare time I love being taken for walks by my dog, exploring new cities, and keeping up with
                    web design trends and technologies. I'm currently looking for companies that believe in remote work
                    and the pursuit of work-life balance. I am always looking to expand my horizons by taking on new
                    projects, learning new toolsets, and meeting new people. So reach out and <a rel="me"
